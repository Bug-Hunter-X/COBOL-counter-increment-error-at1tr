This repository contains a COBOL program that demonstrates a potential error in incrementing a counter using a PERFORM VARYING statement. The program initializes a counter to 0 and then uses a PERFORM VARYING statement to increment the counter 10 times.  However, if an error occurs during the execution of the loop, the counter may not be incremented properly. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach to ensure correct counter incrementation even under error conditions.
